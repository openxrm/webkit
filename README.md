[Work in progress] 

A small project as starting point for web applications that needs to fit in the browser's document body with a 100% of the available screen.

Flexbox layout will be the base for the border layout css classes and will try to avoid as much as it can the use of absolute and fixed
positions.

Making this responsive is also part of the plan.
