webkit

This is a work in progress. 

The main reason for publishing this small project is to provide a border-layout for web applications that needs to fit always in the browser document
avoiding the scroll for the whole page. We are going to make this cross-browser and responsive using flexbox layout and will try to avoid absolute 
and fixed positions as much as we can.
